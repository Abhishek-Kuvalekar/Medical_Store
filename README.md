# Medical_Store
A basic medical software.

This project is developed using NetBeans. Copy the source code in you src/medical_storage directory. You need MySQL as a database server and JDBC as a connecting library. Enter your MySQL username and password in db.properties and change the path to that file in MySQL_Connector class. Insert entries to tables and start using it. :)

Feel free to contribute if you are interested. Pull requests are always welcomed!
